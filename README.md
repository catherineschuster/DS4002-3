# DS 4002: Project 3 - Is the Economy an Indicator of American Burnout?
## Contents

The Bureau of Labor and Statistics reported in 2020 that work-related stress drains the US economy by 300 billion dollars a year, making up 12% of our country’s GDP [1]. This study centers around the topic of chronic stress and ‘burnout’, a “syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed”, characterized by exhaustion and increased mental distance from one’s job [2]. This project seeks to investigate the relationship between workplace stress, productivity, and economic metrics, which indicate recessionary periods, periods of expansion, and unprecedented times (ex., dot com boom, COVID, etc.). These specific time periods of significant economic volatility are notable because they can be naturally stress-inducing. We use time series analysis to examine the relationship between Gallop’s stress index, organizational data for employee productivity, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ cost of labor index against quarter-over-quarter change in GDP [3-7].

Hypothesis: Workplace productivity measures and well-being indexes will be statistically significantly lower during recessionary periods compared to periods of growth according to quarter-over-quarter change in GDP per capita. 
Potenetial new hypothesis: Workplace productivity measures and stress indexes have a statistically significant synchronized relationship with quarter-over-quarter change in GDP per capita.
